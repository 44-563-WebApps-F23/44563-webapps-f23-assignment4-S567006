            Good day, Doctor Rank. I knew your ring. But you mustn’t go in to
            Torvald now; I think he is busy with something.<br>
            
            <h6>RANK.</h6><br>
            And you?<br>
            
            <h6>NORA.</h6><br>
            _[brings him in and shuts the door after him]_. Oh, you know very well
            I always have time for you.<br>
            
            <h6>RANK.</h6><br>
            Thank you. I shall make use of as much of it as I can.<br>
            
            <h6>NORA.</h6><br>
            What do you mean by that? As much of it as you can?<br>
            
            <h6>RANK.</h6><br>
            Well, does that alarm you?<br>
            
            <h6>NORA.</h6><br>
            It was such a strange way of putting it. Is anything likely to happen?<br>
            
            <h6>RANK.</h6><br>
            Nothing but what I have long been prepared for. But I certainly didn’t
            expect it to happen so soon.<br>
