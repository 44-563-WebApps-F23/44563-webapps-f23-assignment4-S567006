            <h6>NORA.</h6><br>
            Torvald, I don’t believe you mean that.
            
            <h6>HELMER.</h6><br>
            Don’t you? Why not?
            
            <h6>NORA.</h6><br>
            Because it is such a narrow-minded way of looking at things.
            
            <h6>HELMER.</h6><br>
            What are you saying? Narrow-minded? Do you think I am narrow-minded?
            
            <h6>NORA.</h6><br>
            No, just the opposite, dear—and it is exactly for that reason.
            
            <h6>HELMER.</h6><br>
            It’s the same thing. You say my point of view is narrow-minded, so I
            must be so too. Narrow-minded! Very well—I must put an end to this.
            _[Goes to the hall door and calls.]_ Helen!
            
            <h6>NORA.</h6><br>
            What are you going to do?
            
            <h6>HELMER.</h6><br>
            _[looking among his papers]_. Settle it. _[Enter MAID.]_ Look here;
            take this letter and go downstairs with it at once. Find a messenger
            and tell him to deliver it, and be quick. The address is on it, and
            here is the money.
            
            <h6>MAID.</h6><br>
            Very well, sir. _[Exit with the letter.]_
            
            <h6>HELMER.</h6><br>
            _[putting his papers together]_. Now then, little Miss Obstinate.
            
            <h6>NORA.</h6><br>
            _[breathlessly]_. Torvald—what was that letter?
            
            <h6>HELMER.</h6><br>
            Krogstad’s dismissal.
            
            <h6>NORA.</h6><br>
            Call her back, Torvald! There is still time. Oh Torvald, call her back!
            Do it for my sake—for your own sake—for the children’s sake! Do you
            hear me, Torvald? Call her back! You don’t know what that letter can
            bring upon us.
            
            <h6>HELMER.</h6><br>
            It’s too late.
            
            <h6>NORA.</h6><br>
            Yes, it’s too late.
            
            <h6>HELMER.</h6><br>
            My dear Nora, I can forgive the anxiety you are in, although really it
            is an insult to me. It is, indeed. Isn’t it an insult to think that I
            should be afraid of a starving quill-driver’s vengeance? But I forgive
            you nevertheless, because it is such eloquent witness to your great
            love for me. _[Takes her in his arms.]_ And that is as it should be, my
            own darling Nora. Come what will, you may be sure I shall have both
            courage and strength if they be needed. You will see I am man enough to
            take everything upon myself.
            
            <h6>NORA.</h6><br>
            _[in a horror-stricken voice]_. What do you mean by that?
            
            <h6>HELMER.</h6><br>
            Everything, I say—
            
            <h6>NORA.</h6><br>
            _[recovering herself]_. You will never have to do that. </p>
