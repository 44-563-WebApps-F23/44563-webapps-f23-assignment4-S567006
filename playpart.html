                Torvald, I don’t believe you mean that.

                Because it is such a narrow-minded way of looking at things.

                What are you saying? Narrow-minded? Do you think I am narrow-minded?

                No, just the opposite, dear—and it is exactly for that reason.

            It’s the same thing. You say my point of view is narrow-minded, so I
            must be so too. Narrow-minded! Very well—I must put an end to this.

            My dear Nora, I can forgive the anxiety you are in, although really it
            is an insult to me. It is, indeed. Isn’t it an insult to think that I
            should be afraid of a starving quill-driver’s vengeance? But I forgive
            you nevertheless, because it is such eloquent witness to your great
            love for me. <h6 class="direction">_[Takes her in his arms.]_ </h6> 
            And that is as it should be, my own darling Nora. Come what will, you may be sure 
            I shall have both courage and strength if they be needed. You will see 
            I am man enough to take everything upon myself.
        </p>
